IMPORTANT

i've replaced this package with gaq_hub, which consists of a generalized 'hub' object, and helpers for pyramid and pylons to manage it.

this package will no longer be maintained

the 0.0.6 version it is largely backwards compatible with this release, with a few minor changes:
	1. gaq_print() was renamed to gaq_as_html()
	2. "from pylons_gaq import *" is now "from gaq_hub.pylons_helpers import *"

=================
=================

pyramid_gaq gives lightweight support for Google Analytics under pyramid

it creates and manages a _gaq namespace under request.tmpl_context, which can be updated in handlers and templates, and printed out -- in the correct order -- via a helper function

if you're just using _trackPageview, this package is likely overkill 

but if you're using any of this functionality, then its for you:
- custom variables for performance analytics 
- event tracking for backend interaction / operations 
- ecommerce tracking 
- rolling up multiple domains into 1 reporting suite

This package lets you set GA code wherever needed, and renders everything in the 'correct' order.

Every command has extensive docstrings, which also include, credit, and link to the relevant sections of the official GoogleAnalytics API docs.

# Pylons and Pyramid

if you're using pylons, there is also a pylons_gaq distribution that does the exact same thing.

if you're using pyramid, there is also a pyramid_gaq distribution that does the exact same thing.

# QuickStart

## import this into your helpers

Dropping it into your helpers namespace makes it easier to use in templates like mako.

lib/helpers.py

    from pyramid_gaq import *
    

## configure your BaseController to call gaq_setup on __init__

This example is from my "pylons style hander".

There are only two vars to submit:

1. Your Google Analytics Account ID
2. Whether or not your want to use the "Single Push" method, or a bunch of separate events.

handlers/base.py

	class Handler(object):
	    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request
        h.gaq_setup(request,'GA_ACCOUNT_ID',single_push=False)


## When you want to set a custom variable , or anything similar...

	h.gaq_setCustomVar(1,'TemplateVersion','A',3)

	
## To print this out..

In my mako templates, I just have this...

	<head>
	...
	${h.gaq_print()|n}
	...
	</head>

Notice that you have to escape under Mako.   For more information on mako escape options - http://www.makotemplates.org/docs/filtering.html
